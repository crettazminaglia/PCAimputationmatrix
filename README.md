# PCAimputationmatrix
This is a repository that contains a simple principal component analysis (PCA) with an imputation matrix using R.

## Before, some considerations:
1- PCA needs quantitative data.
2- Using FactoMineR library, it is not necessary for data normalization. Original data were used.
3- Imputation matrix is used when there are NULL data.
4- Check data!!!
